# Tinbet

Tinbet is a tinder-like decentralized betting platform built on Solana by [Gonna Make It](https://twitter.com/GonnaMakeIt_HQ).

Tinbet integrates [Monaco Protocol](https://www.monacoprotocol.xyz/) for price discovery and allows you to bet in some outcomes of events and markets from [BetDex](https://www.betdex.com/).

This project has been enterely designed and implemented for the [Sandstorm Hackathon](https://www.sandstormhackathon.com/) presented by [LamportDAO](https://twitter.com/LamportDAO) and [Helius Labs](https://helius.xyz/).

## How to use

This project isnâ€™t meant to be used for professional or high stakes/advanced betting, but rather for having fun and learning about Decentralized Sports Betting.

You can try it out [here](https://tinbet.vercel.app/).

## Repository

This repository contains the Tinder-like ux frontend built with NextJS and the HonoJs backend that runs in Cloudflare Workers to provide the final user a blazingly fast experience.
